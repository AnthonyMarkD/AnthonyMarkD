### Hello!

My name is Anthony Dmytryshyn and I am an aspiring Computer Engineer. I love to tackle on new problems with the goal of helping people achieve cool creations which help benefit human kind in some way, whether it affects 1 person to the whole globe.

My passion is in Android Development, and I am currently learning Jetpack Compose. As long as my work helps out anybody else, I am a happy man.
